# To Do List

A simple to-do list application created using React.

This application has the ability to add new tasks, edit created tasks, and delete tasks.

## Icons:

The trash can icon used can be found from FontAwesome.com. 
Information for installation and usage of Font Awesome in react can be found here: https://github.com/FortAwesome/react-fontawesome

## Future Plans:

I would like to further develop upon this app by giving it the ability to automatically resize itself and thus become mobile friendly.
